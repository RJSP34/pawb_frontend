# Psoriasis Image Submission and Clinical Feedback Web Application

## Introduction
Psoriasis Image Submission and Clinical Feedback Web Application is a platform designed to facilitate the submission of images of psoriasis-affected skin by patients and enable authorized clinicians to provide feedback. This README provides an overview of the project and its features.

## Features

1.  User Registration:
	-   Users can register using their email address and password to access the website's features.

2.  Image Submission:
    -   Authenticated users can upload pictures of their psoriasis-affected skin, which are securely stored on the server-side.

3.  Image Management:
    - Authenticated users can view, update, and delete their uploaded images.
    - Users can filter images based on date and body positions.

4.  Clinical Feedback:
    - Users can authorize clinicians to view their uploaded images.
    - Authorized clinicians can access the images and provide feedback to the patients.
    - Multiple clinicians can be authorized for the same patient's images.
    - Clinicians can leave textual feedback for the patient.

5.  Image Security:
    - All images are encrypted using a secure mechanism to ensure privacy.
    - Only the patient and authorized clinicians can view the images by logging into the web application.
    -   The web application employs appropriate security measures, such as SSL/TLS encryption, secure password storage, and two-factor authentication.

6.  Future Enhancements:  
	- Add  support  for  video  submissions  to  allow  users  to  capture  the  
progression of their psoriasis over time.  
	- Implement a feature to allow users to share their images with others for  
research or educational purposes, with their consent  
	- Be able to relate a new image to a previous one in order to follow the  
clinical evolution of a given patient (timeline)

Every feature from 1. to 5. are done, with the exception of two-factor authentication.

## Installation

### Frontend Setup
Before setting up the frontend, the other services are required. The backend, database and Redis should be prioritized.

To set up the frontend of the Psoriasis Image Submission and Clinical Feedback Web Application, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JFSL98/pawb_frontend_2023
cd pawb_frontend_2023
``` 
    
2.  Install the required dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
``` 
    
3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the `pawb_frontend_2023` directory and provide the necessary environment variables
    
4. Start the development server:
```bash
yarn start
``` 
    
5. Access the web application in your browser at `http://localhost:3001`.

### Docker Compose Setup
To set up the Psoriasis Image Submission and Clinical Feedback Web Application using Docker Compose, the following docker-compose.yml file is required in the same folder as the backend and the frontend:

```dockerfile
version: "3.9"
services:
	app:
		container_name: app_backend
		build: ./pawb_backend_2023
		ports:
			- 3000:3000
		restart: on-failure
		volumes:
			- ./pawb_backend_2023:/app
		depends_on:
			- database
			- redis
	database:
		container_name: mariadb
		image: mariadb:10.11.2
		environment:
		MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
		MYSQL_DATABASE: ${DB_DATABASE}
		MYSQL_USER: ${DB_USERNAME}
		MYSQL_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
		restart: on-failure
		volumes:
			- ./mariadb:/var/lib/mysql
		ports:
			- 3306:3306
	react:
		container_name: app_frontend
		build: ./pawb_frontend_2023
		restart: on-failure
		volumes:
			- ./pawb_frontend_2023/src:/app/src
		depends_on:
			- app
		ports:
			- 3001:3000
	redis:
		container_name: redis
		image: redis:7.0.11
		restart: on-failure
		ports:
			- 6379:6379
```

Then follow these steps:
1. Clone the repositories:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JFSL98/pawb_frontend_2023
git clone https://github.com/JFSL98/pawb_backend_2023
``` 

2. Setup the `.env`
3. Build and run the application using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
4. Access the web application in your browser at `http://localhost:3001`.

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed and properly configured on your machine before running the above steps.

## Deployment
The services for the frontend, backend and Redis are being hosted on [Render](https://render.com/), while the database is on [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/).
